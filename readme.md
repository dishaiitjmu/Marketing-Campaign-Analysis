#Marketing Campaign Analysis
#Project Overview
This project explores a real-world marketing campaign dataset to analyze customer behavior and design data-driven strategies for better ROI.
The focus is on:
Understanding customer demographics & spending behavior
Identifying key drivers of campaign success
Segmenting customers using KMeans clustering
Providing business insights that a marketing team could directly act upon
#Dataset
Source: Customer Personality Analysis – Kaggle
Customers: ~2,200

#Key Features:
Age, income, family structure
Spending across product categories (wines, meat, gold, etc.)
Campaign response history
Recency (days since last purchase)

#Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy) → data prep
Matplotlib / Seaborn → visual insights
scikit-learn → clustering, preprocessing
ydata-profiling → quick exploratory analysis

#Workflow

Data Preparation
Clean missing values, outliers
Create new features (e.g., age, family size, total spend)
Scale numerical values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Who are the customers (age, income distribution)?
How does spending vary by segment (e.g., young families vs. older singles)?
Which customers respond to campaigns?
Customer Segmentation
KMeans clustering (elbow method used to select k)
Group customers into meaningful segments
Business Insights (Realistic Examples)
High-income professionals → buy premium items → target with luxury bundles
Young families → respond better to discounts → design family combo offers
Older customers → purchase consistently but in smaller amounts → focus on loyalty programs

#Sample Visuals
Chart	Why It Matters
Identifies income groups to target premium vs. discount offers
Shows generational differences in product preferences
Visualizes customer segments for campaign personalization

#Key Takeaways
Customer segmentation helps companies avoid “one-size-fits-all” campaigns.
Identified 3–4 actionable customer groups: premium buyers, discount-seekers, loyal low-spenders.
Recommendations can directly improve campaign ROI, engagement, and retention.

This project bridges the gap between data science and business — showing how analytics can translate into real marketing strategy.
